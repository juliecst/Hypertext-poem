                My silhouettes are multiplying in the mirror, where they come from I cannot say. Maybe the circles under my eye, the hallows of my achilles tendon.  
                <br>
                My brain jolts itself into being from somewhere past the passed. 
                <br>
                I am searching <a href = "../Part1/index.html" >still waters </a>, searching still. 
                <br>
                When you renounce your claim over space do you renounce your body or accept that itâ€™s not only <a href ="../author">yours</a>.  
                <br>
                Wakeful, <a href = "../Part2_3/" >persisting</a> in the search for something important. We will know it when we find it.
